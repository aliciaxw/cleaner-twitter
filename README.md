# cleaner-twitter
just want the essentials for a cleaner twitter experience? 
tired of seeing topics and hashtags you don't care about on your dash?
this is the userscript for you!

## what exactly does it remove?

* who to follow module
* trends module
* footer module
* moments tab

applicable to front page dashboard and individual profiles.

## how to use
you will need some sort of userscript manager for your browser (i have only tested this on tampermonkey for chrome, sorry firefox users!)
create a new script and paste this code in, then save. should work automatically.

note: there's a bit of a fake fix for a bug when switching urls without reloading - will result in minor increase in page loading time.
i will fix eventually!
